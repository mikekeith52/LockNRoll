# Double Deep Q Learning

Using a framework obsensibly developed by [Greg Surma](https://gsurma.medium.com/atari-reinforcement-learning-in-depth-part-1-ddqn-ceaa762a546f), I trained an AI to learn Lock N' Roll. There were several barriers to overcome, including how to restrict its action space, since not all moves are available at all times, how to feed a reasonably sized observation space, and how to have it respond to the random nature of the game. My solution was by no means perfect, and I am still in the process of developing the learning agent through much trial and tribululation, but after hundreds of thousands of training iterations, there is evidence that it is better than a random player. It is nowhere near my own level (I can regularly score in the 10s of thousands, even having scored over 2 million in two games that I can remember), but it is good for nearly 200 points per game on average and regularly scores over 2,000. A random agent scores about 165 and rarely scores over 1,000.  

This is something I will keep developing. For now, it is available to help you play in app.py with selection 5.  

Until next time, keep locking. Keep rolling. Keep resisting. Keep taking down the system from within. Keep being badass. And always remember, Cobra Kai--and I cannot stress this enough--never dies.
